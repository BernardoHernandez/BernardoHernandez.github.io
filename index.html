<h3>Current Affiliation </h3>
Research Associate,<br>
Department of Automatic Control and Systems Engineering<br>
Faculty of Engineering<br>
University of Sheffield<br><br>

<h3>Current Research</h3>
I am currently a Research Associate in Dynamic Modelling and Control for Autonomous Vehicles
part of the EU-H2020 <a href="https://www.dreams4cars.eu/en">Dreams4Cars</a> projects.
My research focuses on the estimation of forward models of ground vehicle dynamics for the purpose of
forward control design.

<h3>Research profile and interest</h3>
I hold a PhD from the Automatic Control and Systems Engineering department at the Univesity of Sheffield, UK (2018).
My <a href="http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/22174/">Doctorate Thesis</a> focuses on the design of Model
Predictive Control (MPC) based controllers for time-varying, distributed and switching systems.<br>

During 2017 I performed as a Research Assistant at the Rolls-Royce university technology center at the Department of 
Automatic Control and Systems Engineering at the University of Sheffield.<br>

Prior to my PhD I obtained an MEng in Mechanical Engineering (2013) and a BEng in Aerospace Engineering (2012)
from the University of Concepcion, Chile. My masters final project focused on the implementaiton and optimisation
of an automatic control platform in a UAV.<br>

My current research interests are in the broad field of model-based control and linear modelling. More particularly in
the design of model-based controllers for uncertain and changing systems, where uncertainty may arise from inaccuracies
inherent to the modelling process.
